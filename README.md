# Friendly bootloader

An experimental bootloader written entirely in x86 assembly.

Goals:
    - Simple Filesystem
    - Support a popular or custom boot protocol like stivale or multiboot
    - Load and run kernel elf
    - Support 64 bit kernels only

Features:
    - It can't do anything, I just started this :^)
